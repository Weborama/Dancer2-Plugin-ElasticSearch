=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dancer2::Plugin::ElasticSearch;
  get '/count_all_docs' => sub {
    return elastic->search(search_type => 'count',
                           body => { query => { match_all => {} } });
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Dancer2 plugin handles connection configuration and
fork-and-thread safety for ElasticSearch connectors.

=head1 KEYWORDS

=head2 elastic

  elastic->ping;
  elastic('other')->ping;

Return a L<Search::Elasticsearch::Client> subclass suitable for
running queries against an ElasticSearch instance.  Each thread is
guaranteed to have its own client instances.  If a connection already
exists for a given configuration name, it is returned instead of being
re-created.  If a new connection is created, C<ping> is immediately
called to check it; this may throw an
L<exception|Search::Elasticsearch::Error> if there is in fact an issue
with the cluster.

If a configuration name is not passed, "default" is assumed.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

  plugins:
    ElasticSearch:
      default:
        params:
          nodes: localhost:9200
      other:
        params: etc

The C<params> hashref must contain a map of parameters that can be
passed directly to the L<Search::Elasticsearch> constructor.  In the
above example, calling C<elastic> (or C<elastic('default')>) will
result in

  Search::Elasticsearch->new(nodes => 'localhost:9200');

=head1 INSTALLATION

You can install this module as you would any Perl module.

During installation, the unit tests will run queries against a local
ElasticSearch instance if there is one (read-only queries, of
course!).  If you have no local ElasticSearch instance, but still wish
to run the unit tests, set the C<D2_PLUGIN_ES> variable to
"$host:$port".  If no instance can be reached, the tests will be
safely skipped.
